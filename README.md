# Travel EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Travel dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. This project focuses on analyzing travel data to understand different factors that impact travel behavior and preferences. 

## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a key step in the data analysis pipeline. In this project, I have performed EDA on a travel dataset to extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualizations, and summary statistics to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Travel Dataset](#)
- **Description**: The dataset contains various travel-related features, such as destinations, prices, dates, user ratings, etc.

## Features

Some of the key features of the dataset include:
- **Destination**: Location of the travel destination.
- **Price**: Cost of travel.
- **Date**: Date of travel.
- **Rating**: User satisfaction rating.
- **Transportation Mode**: Means of travel.

## Analysis Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Standardizing formats

2. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Distribution of travel prices
   - Popular destinations
   - Trends over time
   - Correlation between features

3. **Key Insights**: 
   - Average cost for popular destinations
   - Preferred modes of transportation
   - Rating analysis across different destinations

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: The primary language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Usage

To run the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/8077364606/Travel-EDA.git
cd Travel-EDA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis:

```bash
jupyter notebook Travel_EDA.ipynb
```

## Conclusion

The Travel EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of travel behaviors, preferences, and trends. It helps identify patterns such as popular travel destinations, cost trends, and preferred modes of transportation.

## Future Scope

- More detailed analysis of seasonal trends.
- Incorporation of additional datasets for deeper insights.
- Predictive modeling based on travel data.
